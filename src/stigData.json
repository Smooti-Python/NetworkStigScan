A downgrade can be determined based on the criteria above.",
                "description": "Since NTP is used to ensure accurate log file time stamp information, NTP could pose a security risk if a malicious user were able to falsify NTP information. To launch an attack on the NTP infrastructure, a hacker could inject time that would be accepted by NTP clients by spoofing the IP address of a valid NTP server. To mitigate this risk, the time messages must be authenticated by the client before accepting them as a time source. \n\nTwo NTP-enabled devices can communicate in either client-server mode or peer-to-peer mode (aka \"symmetric mode\"). The peering mode is configured manually on the device and indicated in the outgoing NTP packets. The fundamental difference is the synchronization behavior: an NTP server can synchronize to a peer with better stratum, whereas it will never synchronize to its client regardless of the client's stratum. From a protocol perspective, NTP clients are no different from the NTP servers. The NTP client can synchronize to multiple NTP servers, select the best server and synchronize with it, or synchronize to the averaged value returned by the servers.\n\nA hierarchical model can be used to improve scalability. With this implementation, an NTP client can also become an NTP server providing time to downstream clients at a higher stratum level and of decreasing accuracy than that of its upstream server. To increase availability, NTP peering can be used between NTP servers. In the event the device loses connectivity to its upstream NTP server, it will be able to choose time from one of its peers. \n\nThe NTP authentication model is opposite of the typical client-server authentication model. NTP authentication enables an NTP client or peer to authenticate time received from their servers and peers. It is not used to authenticate NTP clients because NTP servers do not care about the authenticity of their clients, as they never accept any time from them.",

When uRPF is enabled on an interface, the router examines all packets received as input on that interface to make sure that the source address and source interface appear in the routing table and match the interface on which the packet was received.  If the packet was received from one of the best reverse path routes, the packet is forwarded as normal.  If there is no reverse path route on the same interface from which the packet was received, it might mean that the source address was modified.  If Unicast RPF does not find a reverse path for the packet, the packet is dropped.\n\nIf internal nodes automatically configure an address based on a prefix from a bogus Router Advertisement a dangerous situation may exist. An internal host may contact an internal server which responds with a packet that could be routed outside of the network via default routing (because the routers do not recognize the destination address as an internal address).  \n\nTo prevent this, filtering should be applied to network interfaces between internal host LANs and internal server LANs to insure that source addresses have valid prefixes. \n",

In addition, traffic accessing the managed elements should be originated at the NOC. In the example the management network at the NOC is 10.2.2.0/24.\n\naccess-list 100 permit ip 10.2.2.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.1.22\naccess-list 100 deny ip any any log\n\nNote that the destination used by any host within the management network to access the managed elements  must be via the management interface. The loopback should not be a valid address since these prefixes would not be advertised into the management network IGP domain. This could only be possible if the managed network Elements: had an IGP adjacency with the managed network, which should not be the case.\n\nStep 3: Verify that the egress ACL blocks any traffic not originated by the managed element \n\naccess-list 101 deny ip any any log\n\nCisco router-generated packets are not inspected by outgoing access-lists. Hence, the above configuration would simply drop any packets not generated by the router itself and allow all local traffic. To filter local traffic, IOS provides a feature called local policy routing, which enables the administrator to apply a route-map to any local router-generated traffic. To prohibit outgoing traffic from the local router to any destination other than the NOC, the a configuration such as the following could be used:\n\n! Do not drop traffic destined to 10.2.2.0/24. Hence, do not include it in \n! the local policy route map, but include all other destinations.\n!\nip access-list extended BLOCK_INVALID_DEST\n deny ip any 10.2.2.0 0.0.0.255\n permit ip any any\n!\nroute-map LOCAL_POLICY 10\n match ip address BLOCK_INVALID_DEST\n set interface Null 0\n!\nip local policy route-map LOCAL_POLICY\n\n\nAlternative Solution: The IOS Management Plane Protection Feature\n\nCisco introduced the Management Plane Protection (MPP) feature with IOS 12.4(6)T which allows any physical in-band interface to be dedicated for OOB management. The MPP feature allows a network operator to designate one or more router interfaces as management interfaces. Management traffic is permitted to enter a device only through these management interfaces. All of the other in-band interfaces not enabled for MPP will automatically drop all ingress packets associated with any of the supported MPP protocols (FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SSH, SNMP, Telnet, and TFTP). Hence, after MPP is enabled, no interfaces except management interfaces will accept network management traffic destined to the device. This feature also provides the capability to restrict which management protocols are allowed. This feature does not change the behavior of the console, auxiliary, and management Ethernet interfaces. The following configuration example depicts FastEthernet1/1 as being the designated management interface that will only allow ssh and snmp traffic.\n\n\ncontrol-plane host\n management-interface FastEthernet1/1 allow ssh snmp\n!\ninterface FastEthernet1/1\n description Enclave_Management_LAN\n ip address 10.1.1.22 255.255.255.0 \n",

In either case, the management interface of the managed network element will be directly connected to the OOBM network.\n\nAn OOBM interface does not forward transit traffic; thereby, providing complete separation of production and management traffic. Since all management traffic is immediately forwarded into the management network, it is not exposed to possible tampering.  The separation also ensures that congestion or failures in the managed network do not affect the management of the device.

CoPP allows network operators to classify traffic based on importance that then enables the router to filter and rate limit the traffic according to the defined policy for each class.\n\nStep 1: Verify traffic types have been classified based on importance levels. The following is an example configuration:\n\nclass-map match-all CoPP_CRITICAL\n match access-group name CoPP_CRITICAL\nclass-map match-any CoPP_IMPORTANT\n match access-group name CoPP_IMPORTANT\n match protocol arp\nclass-map match-all CoPP_NORMAL\n match access-group name CoPP_NORMAL\nclass-map match-any CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\n match access-group name CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\nclass-map match-all CoPP_DEFAULT\n match access-group name CoPP_DEFAULT\n\nStep 2: Review the ACLs referenced by the match access-group commands to determine if the traffic is being classified appropriately. The following is an example configuration:\n\nip access-list extended CoPP_CRITICAL\n remark our control plane adjacencies are critical\n permit ospf host [OSPF neighbor A] any\n permit ospf host [OSPF neighbor B] any\n permit pim host [PIM neighbor A] any\n permit pim host [PIM neighbor B] any\n permit pim host [RP addr] any\n permit igmp any 224.0.0.0 15.255.255.255\n permit tcp host [BGP neighbor] eq bgp host [local BGP addr]\n permit tcp host [BGP neighbor] host [local BGP addr] eq bgp\n deny ip any any\n\nip access-list extended CoPP_IMPORTANT\n permit tcp host [TACACS server] eq tacacs any\n permit tcp [management subnet] 0.0.0.255 any eq 22\n permit udp host [SNMP manager] any eq snmp\n permit udp host [NTP server] eq ntp any\n deny ip any any\n\nip access-list extended CoPP_NORMAL\n remark we will want to rate limit ICMP traffic\n permit icmp any any echo\n permit icmp any any echo-reply\n permit icmp any any time-exceeded\n permit icmp any any unreachable\n deny ip any any\n\nip access-list extended CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\n remark other management plane traffic that should not be received\n permit udp any any eq ntp\n permit udp any any eq snmptrap\n permit tcp any any eq 22\n permit tcp any any eq 23\n remark other control plane traffic not configured on router\n permit eigrp any any\n permit udp any any eq rip\n deny ip any any\n\nip access-list extended CoPP_DEFAULT\n permit ip any any\n\n\nNote: Explicitly defining undesirable traffic with ACL entries enables the network operator to collect statistics. Excessive ARP packets can potentially monopolize Route Processor resources, starving other important processes. Currently, ARP is the only Layer 2 protocol that can be specifically classified using the match protocol command. \n\nStep 3: Review the policy-map to determine if the traffic is being policed appropriately for each classification. The following is an example configuration:\n\n\npolicy-map CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY\n class CoPP_CRITICAL\npolice 512000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action transmit\nclass CoPP_IMPORTANT\n police 256000 4000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop\nclass CoPP_NORMAL\n police 128000 2000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop\nclass CoPP_UNDESIRABLE\n police 8000 1000 conform-action drop exceed-action drop\nclass cp-default-in\n police 64000 1000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that the CoPP policy is enabled. The following is an example configuration:\n\ncontrol-plane\n service-policy input CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY\n\n\nNote: Starting with IOS release 12.4(4)T, Control Plane Protection (CPPr) can be used to filter as well as police control plane traffic destined to the RP. CPPr is very similar to CoPP and has the ability to filter and police traffic using finer granularity by dividing the aggregate control plane into three separate categories: (1) host, (2) transit, and (3) CEF-exception. Hence, a separate policy-map could be configured for each traffic category.\n\n\nIf CoPP is not supported, then the alternative would be the implementation of a receive path filter.\n\nStep 1: A receive path ACL or an inbound ACL on each interface must be configured to restrict traffic destined to the router. The IOS IP Receive ACL feature provides filtering capability explicitly for traffic that is destined for the router. Verify that the global ip receive acl statement has been configured as shown in the following example:\n\nip receive acl 199\n\nNote: If the platform does not support the ip receive path acl feature, an inbound ACL on each interface must be configured.\n\nStep 2: Verify that the ACL referenced by the ip receive acl statement restricts all control plane and management plane traffic. The ACL configuration should look similar to the following: \n\naccess-list 199 deny ip any any fragments\naccess-list 199 remark allow specific management plane traffic\naccess-list 199 permit tcp [management subnet] 0.0.0.255 any eq 22\naccess-list 199 permit udp host [SNMP manager] any eq snmp\naccess-list 199 permit tcp host [TACACS server] eq tacacs any\naccess-list 199 permit udp host [NTP server] eq ntp any\naccess-list 199 permit icmp [management subnet] 0.0.0.255 any \naccess-list 199 remark allow specific control plane traffic\naccess-list 199 permit ospf host [OSPF neighbor A] any\naccess-list 199 permit ospf host [OSPF neighbor B] any\naccess-list 199 permit pim host [PIM neighbor A] any\naccess-list 199 permit pim host [PIM neighbor B] any\naccess-list 199 permit pim host [RP addr] any\naccess-list 199 permit igmp any 224.0.0.0 15.255.255.255\naccess-list 199 permit tcp host [BGP neighbor] eq bgp host [local BGP addr]\naccess-list 199 permit tcp host [BGP neighbor] host [local BGP addr] eq bgp\naccess-list 199 remark all other traffic destined to the device is dropped\naccess-list 199 deny ip any any\n\n\nNote: If the Management Plane Protection (MPP) feature is enabled for an OOBM interface, there would be no purpose in filtering this traffic on the receive path. With MPP enabled, no interfaces except the management interface will accept network management traffic destined to the device. This feature also provides the capability to restrict which management protocols are allowed. See NET0992 for additional configuration information.\n",
                "description": "The Route Processor (RP) is critical to all network operations as it is the component used to build all forwarding paths for the data plane via control plane processes. It is also instrumental with ongoing network management functions that keep the routers and links available for providing network services. Hence, any disruption to the RP or the control and management planes can result in mission critical network outages. \n\nIn addition to control plane and management plane traffic that is in the router\u2019s receive path, the RP must also handle other traffic that must be punted to the RP\u2014that is, the traffic must be fast or process switched. This is the result of packets that must be fragmented, require an ICMP response (TTL expiration, unreachable, etc.) have IP options, etc. A DoS attack targeting the RP can be perpetrated either inadvertently or maliciously involving high rates of punted traffic resulting in excessive RP CPU and memory utilization. To maintain network stability, the router must be able to securely handle specific control plane and management plane traffic that is destined to it, as well as other punted traffic. \n\nUsing the ingress filter on forwarding interfaces is a method that has been used in the past to filter both forwarding path and receiving path traffic. However, this method does not scale well as the number of interfaces grows and the size of the ingress filters grow. Control plane policing can be used to increase security of routers and multilayer switches by protecting the RP from unnecessary or malicious traffic. Filtering and rate limiting the traffic flow of control plane packets can be implemented to protect routers against reconnaissance and DoS attacks allowing the control plane to maintain packet forwarding and protocol states despite an attack or heavy load on the router or multilayer switch.\n\n",

Such a router is said to be a boundary for multicast scoped addresses in the range defined in its configuration. In order to support administratively scoped multicast, a multicast boundary router will drop multicast traffic matching an interface's boundary definition in either direction. \n\nThe IPv4 administrative scoped multicast address space is 239/8 which is divided into two scope levels: the Local Scope and Organization Local Scope.  The Local Scope range is 239.255.0.0/16 and can expand into the reserved ranges 239.254.0.0/16 and 239.253.0.0/16 if 239.255.0.0/16 is exhausted. The IPv4 Organization Local Scope is 239.192.0.0/14 is the space from which an organization should allocate sub-ranges when defining scopes for private use. This scope can be expanded to 239.128.0.0/10, 239.64.0.0/10, and 239.0.0.0/10 if necessary. The scope of IPv6 multicast packets are determined by the scope value where 4 (ffx4::/16) is Admin-local, 5 (ffx5::/16) is Site-local, and 8 (ffx8::/16) is Organization-local. \n\nReview the multicast topology to determine any documented Admin-local (scope = 4) or Site-local (scope = 5) multicast boundaries for IPv6 traffic or any Local-scope (address block 239.255.0.0/16) boundary for IPv4 traffic. Verify that appropriate boundaries are configured on the applicable multicast-enabled interfaces.\n\nIPv4:\nThe following example will establish a multicast boundary on the interface to ensure that Local-scope traffic is not allowed into or out of the administratively scoped IPv4 multicast region:\n\nip multicast-routing \n!\ninterface FastEthernet0/1\ndescription Boundary for multicast region A \n ip address 198.18.0.1 255.255.255.0\nip pim sparse-mode\nip multicast boundary MCAST_ADMIN_SCOPED_BOUNDARY\n!\nip access-list standard MCAST_ADMIN_SCOPED_BOUNDARY\ndeny   239.255.0.0 0.255.255.255\npermit 224.0.0.0 15.255.255.255\n!\n\nNote: The filter used by multicast boundary command will effect multicast traffic outside of the administratively scoped IPv4 multicast space. If Organization Local Scope traffic must cross this site boundary, include the necessary permit statement from this address range (239.192.0.0 255.252.0.0). To allow global multicast traffic to pass by this boundary, ensure that the filter will permit the global address space (224.0.1.0-238.255.255.255) if the enclave has deployed inter-domain multicast routing. \n\n\nIPv6:\nThe following example will establish a multicast boundary on the interface to ensure that Site-local scope traffic is not allowed into or out of the administratively scoped IPv6 multicast region:\n\nipv6 multicast-routing\n!\ninterface FastEthernet0/1\ndescription link to Site A \n ipv6 address 2001:1:0:146::/64 eui-64\n ipv6 multicast boundary scope 5\n\nNote: Filtering the scope value of 5 will ensure that any multicast traffic received by the interface in either direction with a scope equal to or less than 5 (Site-local) will be dropped.

                "description": "A scope zone is an instance of a connected region of a given scope. Zones of the same scope cannot overlap while zones of a smaller scope will fit completely within a zone of a larger scope. For example, Admin-local scope is smaller than Site-local scope, so the administratively configured boundary fits within the bounds of a site. According to RFC 4007 IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture (section 5), scope zones are also required to be \"convex from a routing perspective\"-that is, packets routed within a zone must not pass through any links that are outside of the zone. This requirement forces each zone to be one contiguous island rather than a series of separate islands. As stated in the DoD IPv6 IA Guidance for MO3, \"One should be able to identify all interfaces of a zone by drawing a closed loop on their network diagram, engulfing some routers and passing through some routers to include only some of their interfaces.\"\n\nAdministrative scoped multicast addresses are locally assigned and are to be used exclusively by the enterprise network or enclave. Hence, administrative scoped multicast traffic must not cross the perimeter of the enclave in either direction. Admin-local scope could be used to contain multicast traffic to a portion of an enclave or within a site. This can make it more difficult for a malicious user to access sensitive traffic if the traffic is restricted to links that the user does not have access to.

The hardware clock runs continuously, even if the router is powered off or rebooted. If the software clock is synchronized to an outside time source via NTP, it is a good practice to periodically update the hardware clock with the time learned from NTP. Otherwise, the hardware clock will tend to gradually lose or gain time (drift) and the software clock and hardware clock may become out of synchronization with each other. The ntp update-calendar command will enable the hardware clock to be periodically updated with the time specified by the NTP source. The hardware clock will be updated only if NTP has synchronized to an authoritative time server. To force a single update of the hardware clock from the software clock, use the clock update-calendar command in user EXEC mode. \n\nNote: Lower end router models (i.e., 2500 series) and access switches (i.e. 2950, 2970, etc) do not have hardware clocks, so this command is not available on those platforms.\nAny NTP-enabled device that receives and accepts time from a stratum-n server can become a stratum-n+1 server.

Because of the nature of the IP addressing architecture, only the last router in the chain, which is connected directly to the target subnet, can conclusively identify a directed broadcast.\n\nIP directed broadcasts are used in the extremely common and popular smurf, or Denial of Service (DoS), attacks. In a smurf attack, the attacker sends ICMP echo requests from a falsified source address to a directed broadcast address, causing all the hosts on the target subnet to send replies to the falsified source. By sending a continuous stream of such requests, the attacker can create a much larger stream of replies, which can completely inundate the host whose address is being falsified. This service should be disabled on all interfaces when not needed to prevent smurf and DoS attacks. Directed broadcast can be enabled on internal facing interfaces to support services such as Wake-On-LAN. Case scenario may also include support for legacy applications where the content server and the clients do not support multicast. The content servers send streaming data using UDP broadcast. Used in conjunction with the ip multicast helper-map feature, broadcast data can be sent across a multicast topology. The broadcast streams are converted to multicast and vice versa at the first-hop routers and last-hop routers before entering leaving the multicast transit area respectively. The last-hop router must convert the multicast to broadcast.

RFC 793 also specifies that RST (reset) control flags should be processed immediately, without waiting for out of sequence packets to arrive.

A router receiving an RST segment will close the TCP session with the BGP peer that is being spoofed; thereby, purging all routes learned from that BGP neighbor. A RST segment is valid as long as the sequence number is within the window. The TCP reset attack is made possible due to the requirements that Reset flags should be processed immediately and that a TCP endpoint must accept out of order packets that are within the range of a window size. This reduces the number of sequence number guesses the attack must make by a factor equivalent to the active window size. Each sequence number guess made by the attacker can be simply incremented by the receiving connections window size.

The TCP header options include an MD5 signature in every packet and are checked prior to the acceptance and processing of any TCP packet\u2014including RST flags.\n\nOne way to create havoc in a network is to advertise bogus routes to a network.

A third key must also be defined with an infinite lifetime. Both of these steps ensure there will always be a key that can be placed into service by all peers. If a time period occurs during which no key is activated, authentication cannot occur; hence, route updates will not occur. The lifetime key should be changed 7 days after successful key rotation and synchronization has occurred with all peers.",

The modem will provide full encryption capability (Triple DES) or stronger.  The technician who manages these devices will be authenticated using a key fob and granted access to the appropriate maintenance port, thus the technician will gain access to the managed device (router, switch, etc.).  The token provides a method of strong (two-factor) user authentication.  The token works in conjunction with a server to generate one-time user passwords that will change values at second intervals.
